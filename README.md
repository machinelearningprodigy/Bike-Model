# 🚴 Model Minder Bike Classifier 🚴  

This project was developed by solely me for some seniors at my college as their final year project. It is a **Streamlit-based image classification app** that uses a pre-trained **EfficientNetB0** model to classify bike images. Simply upload an image, and the model will predict the **top-5 possible bike categories** along with their confidence scores.  

## ✨ Features  
🔹 Upload an image of a bike 🏍️  
🔹 Get top-5 predictions with confidence scores 📊  
🔹 Visualize predictions with a bar chart 📈  
🔹 Download the uploaded image for reference ⬇️  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1️⃣ Run the Streamlit app  
2️⃣ Upload an image (JPG, PNG, or WEBP)  
3️⃣ View classification results & confidence scores  
4️⃣ Download your uploaded image if needed  

🎯 **Built for quick and efficient bike classification using deep learning!** 🚀
